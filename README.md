### Use Lint to Detect Unused Dependencies
Android Studio has built-in Lint checks to detect unused dependencies:

### Open Terminal in Android Studio

### Run:
./gradlew dependencies --configuration implementation  

This will list all dependencies. Then, 

### Run:
./gradlew lint

Check the lint report at:

### Look for warnings about unused dependencies from here
