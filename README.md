## 💡 Programmer Tips & Values

- Write **clean, readable code** — maintainability matters.  
- Use **modular architecture** — break down large problems into smaller, reusable pieces.  
- Debug with intention — understand *why* things fail, not just how.  
- Automate repetitive tasks (build scripts, linting, tests).  
- Invest in **documentation** — it’s as important as code.  
- Share knowledge — code reviews, mentoring, and open-source contribution help both others and yourself.  
- Stay curious — explore new technologies, patterns, and tools.  
- Lead with responsibility — build systems that are not only functional but scalable and secure.
